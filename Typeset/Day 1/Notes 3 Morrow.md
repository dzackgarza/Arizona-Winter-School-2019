# Topological Hochschild Homology  in Arithmetic Geometry

Goals:
- Describe Hochschild and cyclic homology using a classical approach
- Describe the "Topological" counterparts
- Relate these to Algebraic and Arithmetic Geometry

# Classical Theory

This only depends on basic homological algebra, but becomes a bit more interesting when objects with a "perfectoid" flavor are input.

Fix a commutative ring $k$, then for any $k\dash$ algebra $A$ we can form the Hochschild complex
$$
HH(A/k) \definedas A \xleftarrow{\del_1} A^{\tensor_k 2} \xleftarrow{\del_2} A^{\tensor_k 3}\to \cdots \\
\del_1(a_0 \tensor a_1) = a_0a_1 - a_1a_0
\del_2(a_0\tensor a_1\tensor a_2) = 
$$
