# Topological Hochschild Homology  in Arithmetic Geometry

Goals:
- Describe Hochschild and cyclic homology using a classical approach
- Describe the "Topological" counterparts
- Relate these to Algebraic and Arithmetic Geometry

# Classical Theory

This only depends on basic homological algebra, but becomes a bit more interesting when objects with a "perfectoid" flavor are input.

Fix a commutative ring $k$, then for any $k\dash$ algebra we can form the Hochschild complex
