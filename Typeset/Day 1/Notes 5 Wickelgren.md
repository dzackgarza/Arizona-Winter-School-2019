# $\AA^1$ Enumerative Geometry

Enumerative geometry, counts algebro-geometric objects, and in order to actually obtain a number at the end of the day one uses an algebraically closed field $k$ or $\CC$. This is essentially because the conditions imposed are polynomial, and polynomials of degree $n$ over a closed field always have $n$ roots.
