# $\AA^1$ Enumerative Geometry

Enumerative geometry, counts algebro-geometric objects, and in order to actually obtain an invariant number at the end of the day one uses an algebraically closed field $k$ or $\CC$. This is essentially because the conditions imposed are polynomial, and polynomials of degree $n$ over a closed field always have $n$ roots.

The goal here is to record information about the fields of definition. However, since we may no longer have invariant numbers as solutions to polynomial equations, we replace this with a notion of *weights* to get an "invariance of bilinear form" principle instead. Over characteristic not 2, we can use quadratic forms, which ties to Lurie's first talk.

# Example: Lines on a Smooth Cubic Surface
> Joint work with Jesse Kass

A **cubic surface** $X$ consists of the $\CC$ solutions to a polynomial in three variables, i.e. 
$$
X = \theset{(x,y,z) \in \CC^3 \suchthat f(x,y,z) = 0},
$$

where $f$ is degree 3. In general, we want to compactify, so we view $X \injects \CP^3$
