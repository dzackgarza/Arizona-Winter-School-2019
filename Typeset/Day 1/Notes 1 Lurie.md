Motivation: think about classifying quadratic forms, we'd like to know when two are equal -- i.e., when one can be obtained from the other by a linear change of variables.

Examples:
1. $x^2+y^2$
2. $x^2-y^2$
3. $-x^2-y^2$

Note that these are all equivalent over $\CC$, under the map $x \mapsto ix$ which sends $x^2\to-x^2$. But these are not equivalent over $\RR$, since (1) is positive-definite, (2) is indefinite, and (3) is negative definite.

We can similary have forms equivalent over $\RR$ but not over $\ZZ$, e.g. by considering $x^2 + 3y^2$. This is equivalent to (1) over $\RR$, since we have $\sqrt 3$, but not over $\ZZ$.
