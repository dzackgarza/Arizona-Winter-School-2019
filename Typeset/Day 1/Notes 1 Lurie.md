Motivation: think about classifying quadratic forms, we'd like to know when two are equal -- i.e., when one can be obtained from the other by a linear change of variables.

Examples:
1. $x^2+y^2$
2. $x^2-y^2$
3. $-x^2-y^2$

Note that these are all equivalent over $\CC$, under the map $x \mapsto ix$ which sends $x^2\to-x^2$.
