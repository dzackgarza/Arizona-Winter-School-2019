Throughout this lecture, we'll let $X\covers \spec(\FF_q)$ be a smooth, projective, algebraic curve over a finite field. We'll also require that $X$ is geometrically connected, i.e. the ring of global functions on $X$ is exactly $\FF_q$. We'll also write $K_x$ for the fraction field of $X$. It determines and is determined by $X$ uniquely up to isomorphism, and this is what's referred to as the function field. Because of this, the data of a function field is the same as this algebro-geometric data.

There is a strong analogy between the behavior of number fields and that of function fields:

|Number Fields   | Function Fields  |
|---|---|
| A finite extension of $\QQ$  | Fields like $K_X$   |
|Prime numbers $p$ (or point at $\infty$)[^1] | Closed points $x\in X$ |
| $\ZZ/p\ZZ$ | The residue field $\kappa(x)$ at $x$[2] |


Everywhere in this lecture, we'll take $x$ to be a closed point.
