# Review
Let $Y \to \spec(\FF_q)$ be some algebro-geometric object defined over $\FF_q$ -- one can have an algebraic variety in mind, but this is geared towards an algebraic stack such as the moduli stack of $G\dash$bundles on an algebraic curve.

We can then look at the $\FF_q\dash$valued points of $Y$, $Y(\FF_q)$
