## Defining Some Transfers

Recall that we have the sheaves $K^{MW}_*, GW$, and the sheaf property means that an inclusion $K \injects L$ induces a map $\spec(L) \to \spec(K)$. We can take $GW(\spec(L) \to \spec(K))$, and this is exactly the restriction/base change given by $\wait \tensor_k L$ of bilinear forms.
