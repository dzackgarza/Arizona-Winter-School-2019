# Lecture 3: Transfers

## Defining Some Transfers

Recall that we have the sheaves $K^{MW}_*, GW$, and the sheaf property means that an inclusion $K \injects L$ induces a map $\spec(L) \to \spec(K)$. We can take $GW(\spec(L) \to \spec(K))$, and this is exactly the restriction/base change given by $\wait \tensor_k L$ of bilinear forms.

We also saw that these were stable homotopy sheaves, so there should be transfers, and we want to use them for field extensions. Let $K\subset L$ be a finite extension of finite-type schemes over $k$. This leads to transfer maps
$$
\Tr_{L/K}: GW(K) \to GW(L).
$$

There is also a geometric transfer (which is the prettiest!) which we'll define momentarily, given by with multiplication by one of those brackets to define a cohomological transfer. The geometric transfer will depend on a sequence of generators, while, while this choice can be removed for the cohomological transfer. If you use the twisting data you can get an absolute transfer.

In the case where $K\subset L$ is separable, there is a canonical way to explicitly untwist, and the absolute and cohomological transfers agree.  For these two, we took
$$
\Tr(B: V^2 \to L) = V^2 \mapsvia{B} L \mapsvia{\Tr_{W^k}}
$$
where we now view $V$ as a $k\dash$vector space, and $\Tr_{W^k}$ is the trace from Galois theory, the sum of the Galois conjugates.

We'll show that we have this structure for the geometric transfer. If $L = K[z]/\generators{f}$, so we've chosen some generator, then we get an induced map $\spec(L) \overset{z}\injects \PP^1_K$. Since this is a closed immersion corresponding to $z$, we can form a backwards map
$$
\PP^1_K \to {\PP^1_K \over \PP^1_K-\theset{z}} \homotopic \PP^1_L
$$
by crushing everything but $z$, where the last equivalence was seen in the previous lecture. But now we can take $K^{MW}_1(\PP^1_K \to \PP^1_L)$, which is a map
$$
\Tr_{L/K}^{\text{geom}}:  GW(L) \to GW(K)
$$

So we have some transfers.

## Bilinear Forms on Chow Groups

The finale of this morning was going to be adding bilinear forms to Chow groups for the purposes of having a tool in enumerative geometry. So let $X\in\Sm$ and $X^{(i)}$ codimension $i$ reduced, irreducible subschemes of $X$. Then
$$
CH^i(X) = {\bigoplus_{X^{(i)}} \ZZ \over \sim}
$$

where $\sim$ is rational equivalence, the equivalence relation generated by taking subvarieties of $V\subset X\cross \PP^1$ and equating the fibers and the endpoints $V_{\theset{1}} \sim V_{\theset{0}}$, i.e. $V\intersect (X\cross\theset{1}) \sim V\intersect (X\cross\theset{0})$.

These are useful in enumerative geometry -- there are Chern classes, pushforwards, pullbacks, a ring structure, etc. This ring structure lets us do intersection theory, providing some machinery to help with enumerative questions.

The $i$th Chow group, in addition to being a motivic homology group, also has a nice formula due to Bloch that applies in the case of smooth schemes: $CH^i(X) \cong H^i(X; K^{M}_i)$ where the RHS is the Nisnevich cohomology of $X$ with coefficients in Milnor $K\dash$theory.

Oriented Chow groups (AKA Chow-Witt groups) which are the original Chow groups together with a bilinear form. By Borge and Morel, motivated by the Bloch formula above, these can be defined as
$$
\widetilde{CH}{}^i(X) \definedas H^i(X; K_i^{MW}).
$$
