# User's Guide to $\AA^1$ Homotopy Theory
Particularly, arithmetically enriching enumerative results.

Recall from last time that we wanted to form a space analogous to a sphere, given by $\PP^n/ \PP^{n-1}$, which we get from a colimit
$$
\begin{CD}
  \PP^{n-1} @>>> \PP^n \\
  @AAA \selfmap @AAA \\
  \pt @>>> \PP^n/ \PP^{n-1}
\end{CD}
$$
