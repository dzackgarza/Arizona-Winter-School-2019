# User's Guide to $\AA^1$ Homotopy Theory
Particularly, arithmetically enriching enumerative results.

Recall from last time that we wanted to form a space analogous to a sphere, given by $\PP_n/ \PP_{n-1}$, which we get from a colimit
$$
\begin{CD}
  \PP_n @>B>> HH_{n+1}(A/k) \\
  @AA\varepsilon_n A \selfmap @AA\varepsilon_{n+1} A \\
  \Omega^n_{A/k} @>\del_{DR}>> \Omega^{n+1}_{A/k}
\end{CD}
$$
