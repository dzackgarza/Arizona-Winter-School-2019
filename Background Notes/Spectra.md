# Spectra

> We have another aim in constructing the category of spectra. In homology theory the suspension homomorphism σ:hn(X)→hn+1(SX) is always an isomorphism

> there are some things that spaces hide to cohomology theories, and we would like to mod out by this "extra information" that we don't really need when we study spaces by means of cohomology theories. The information that spaces hide is the unstable phenomenon, in the following sense : if X and Y are stably equivalent, for example ΣX≃ΣY, then E∗(X)≅E∗+1(ΣX)≅E∗+1(ΣY)≅E∗(Y) for any generalized cohomology theory E∗. This says that there is no cohomology theory that is going to see a difference between X and Y, so we might as well says that they are "the same"
