# Spectra

> We have another aim in constructing the category of spectra. In homology theory the suspension homomorphism σ:hn(X)→hn+1(SX) is always an isomorphism

> there are some things that spaces hide to cohomology theories, and we would like to mod out by this "extra information" that we don't really need when we study spaces by means of cohomology theories. The information that spaces hide is the unstable phenomenon, in the following sense : if X and Y are stably equivalent, for example ΣX≃ΣY, then E∗(X)≅E∗+1(ΣX)≅E∗+1(ΣY)≅E∗(Y) for any generalized cohomology theory E∗. This says that there is no cohomology theory that is going to see a difference between X and Y, so we might as well says that they are "the same"

> Another good consequence of spectra is Brown representability theorem. It says that any generalized cohomology theory on spaces is representable by a spectra. 

> As an aside, a great reason to care about cohomology theories comes from Adams' two solutions to the Hopf invariant one problem. His first solution uses ordinary cohomology to do the work, but it is very long and makes extensive use of "higher cohomology operations." His second proof (with Atiyah) is beautiful and short, but only because he uses an extraordinary cohomology theory (complex K-theory) to do the job.
